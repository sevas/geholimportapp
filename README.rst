Roadmap
-------

Upcoming
~~~~~~~~

- Get a bundle schedule after supplying several course mnemonics
- Add an "import to Google Calendar" link 
- Get ics/csv files for a user-supplied GeHoL url.

Maybe
~~~~~

- Prettier calendar report (maybe using some kind of calendar view)
- Per-student reports without the need to supply all the courses
