Roadmap
-------

Upcoming
~~~~~~~~

- Generates a downloadable files (csv/ics), rather than presenting the content
- Get a bundle schedule after supplying several course mnemonics
- Generate csv/ics by supplying the complete GeHOL query URL
- Add an "import to Google Calendar" link 


Maybe
~~~~~

- Prettier calendar report (maybe using some kind of calendar view)
- Per-student reports without the need to supply all the courses
