    <h3>Where do you get your data from and why should I trust the schedules I get from this service?</h3>
    <p>We fetch the data directly from the GeHoL service. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>
        content is then parsed using the popular <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">BeautifulSoup</a> python library.
        Events are then created and converted to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">iCalendar</a> or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a> files.
        As far as we're concerned, these files are just another way to present the exact same information.
    </p><p>
        If you won't take our word for it, you can have a look at the code of our underlying library on this
        <a href="http://bitbucket.org/sevas/geholimport">bitbucket repository</a>.
        You can even contribute, if you think it's missing something.
        The code for this entire web application should be released under the same terms, as soon as possible.

    <h3>Something went wrong, what can I do? </h3>
    <p>
        We tried to test this service with many different kind of schedules, from every faculty.
        However, parsing that kind of HTML is very fragile. Even more so when it sometimes comes back with incomplete data.
        We will soon add some sort of feedback strategy, so you can report unsuccessful queries.

    <h3>The GeHoL server is down, now what?</h3>
    <p>
        We have no control over that server. Sometimes it gets disconnected from the internet with no indication of what is going on.
        We try at least to show it clearly in the sidebar on the right.

    <h3>Why is all the site in english ?</h3>
    <p>
        English is the language civilized people speak on the internet. Get used to it.
