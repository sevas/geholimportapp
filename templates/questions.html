        <h3  id="data">Where do you get your data from and why should I trust the schedules I get from this service?</h3>
        <p>We fetch the data directly from the GeHoL service. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>
            content is then parsed using the popular <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">BeautifulSoup</a> python library.
            Events are then created and converted to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">iCalendar</a> or
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a> files.
            As far as we're concerned, these files are just another way to present the exact same information.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you won't take our word for it, you can have a look at the source code of our underlying library on this
            <a href="http://bitbucket.org/sevas/geholimport">bitbucket repository</a>.
            You can even contribute, if you're into that sort of things.
            The source code for this entire web application should be released under the same terms, as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            That being said, keep in mind that the files you download and import from this service are frozen
            snapshots taken from the GeHoL service. These files will contain schedules as they appear on GeHoL, at the time you
            clicked the download link.
            We hope you find it useful, but we won't be able to notify you of possible schedule changes if they occur.
            We have no technical mean to do so. <strong>To be notified of schedule changes, don't forget to check your official
            faculty announcements.</strong> Hopefully they have an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> feed or something.

        <h3  id="usability_matters">Why did you do it?</h3>
        <p>If we forget about the visual presentation, one fundamental flaw of the GeHoL/Scientia paradigm is
        the way the information is presented.</p>
        <p>To take one of the most extreme examples, we don't think anyone is helped by this kind of schedule (click on the
        image to witness it in its full glory):</p>

        <p>
        <a href="/media/Cours.png"><img src="/media/cours_truncated.png" width="100%" alt="extreme scheduling" title="GEHOL, Y U NO HELPFUL?!" /></a>
        </p>

        <p>
            Even with a simpler example, extracting useful information from each event box is tiresome and error-prone. Why should people
            have to convert a week number into a real date ?
        </p>
        <p>
             The purpose of a calendar system is to help you know when some important events occur.
            Using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">iCalendar</a> file format is a more useful way for
            people to retrieve and integrate a schedule in their favorite calendar application.

    <div class="faq-entry">
        <h3 id="geholurl">What do you mean by <i>"complete GeHoL URL"</i> ? </h3>
        <p>
            This service can get you two types of schedules. The first one is per-course schedule. Using the course mnemonic,
            we can easily reconstruct the complete URL and fetch the data for you.
            The second type of schedules, however, is problematic, and we need a little work on your part to generate the iCalendar files.
        </p>
        <p>
            You'll need to go <a href="http://164.15.72.157/GeHoL/horaire_anet.php">here</a> and select the values of interest as you normally would.
            The first two values are mandatory. The third one should be selected only if it makes sense to you. The fourth value won't be used, as we will
            generate events for the whole term. At the end, you should get something like this:
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="/media/Horaires.png"><img src="/media/Horaires.png" width="100%" alt="URL copying" title="Get yourself a GeHoL URL, for awesome superpowers" /></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Right click on the generated URL and copy it.
            Come back to our main page, paste this URL in the input box, click the <b>Get Schedule</b> button:

        <h3  id="snap">Something went wrong, what can I do? </h3>
        <p>
            We tried to test this service with many different sorts of schedules, from every faculty.
            However, parsing that kind of HTML is very fragile. We're not helped by the fact that the GeHoL/Scientia&reg;
            service sometimes yields incomplete data.
            It would help if you could report unsuccessful queries to this address :
            <a href="mailto:geholimportapp@gmail.com?subject=Something about Gehol Importer">geholimportapp@gmail.com</a>.

        <h3  id="gehol_down">The GeHoL server is down, now what?</h3>
        <p>
            We have no control over that server. Sometimes it gets disconnected from the internet with no indication of what is going on.
            We try at least to show it clearly in the sidebar on the right.

    <div class="faq-entry">
        <h3  id="mandatory_ie_hate">The layout of this site looks broken in Internet Explorer</h3>
        <p>
            Yes. Yes it does. And we give up trying to fix it.

            You probably should not explore the internet with that anyway, and try one of the
            <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/landing_chrome.html?hl=en">many</a>

            English is the language civilized people speak on the internet. Get used to it.
