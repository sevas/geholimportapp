      <h3  id="data">Where do you get your data from and why should I trust the schedules I get from this service?</h3>
      <p>We fetch the data directly from the GeHoL
        service. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>
        content is then parsed using the
        popular <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">BeautifulSoup</a>
        python library.  Events are then created and converted
        to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">iCalendar</a>
        or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a>
        files.  As far as we're concerned, these files are just
        another way to present the exact same information.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you won't take our word for it, you can have a look at the
        source code of our underlying library on this
        <a href="http://bitbucket.org/sevas/geholimport">bitbucket
        repository</a>.  You can even contribute, if you're into that
        sort of things. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The source code for the entire Google App Engine
        application is available on this
        <a href="https://bitbucket.org/sevas/geholimportapp">bitbucket
        repository</a>.

        <h3 id="files">
          I clicked a link. I received some file. What do I do now?
        </h3>

        <p>We generate two kinds of files. CSV files can be imported
          in Google Calendar. iCalendar files can be imported in all major
          calendar applications.</p>

        <p>By doing so, keep in mind that the files you download and
          import from this service are frozen snapshots taken from the
          GeHoL service. These files will contain schedules as they
          appear on GeHoL, at the time you clicked the download link.
          We hope you find it useful, but we won't be able to notify
          you of possible schedule changes if they occur.  We have no
          technical mean to do so. <strong>To be notified of schedule
          changes, don't forget to check your official faculty
          announcements.</strong> </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-entry">
        <h3 id="subscribe">Can I add an iCalendar URL as a live feed?</h3>
        <p><strong>TL;DR : </strong>Yes you can.</p>
        
        <p>The files are generated on the fly, so you can copy the link
          and subscribe to it as a live feed, if your
          application supports it.

          By doing so, your calendar application will try to
          refresh and update the events periodically.

          It means that, if a schedule gets modified on GeHoL, the
          changes will appear automatically.
        </p>

        <p>
          This has been tested with Google Calendar and Apple
          iCal. However, we have no control on how often your
          calendar application will try to refresh the
          events. 
          <strong>We still strongly advise to check your
            official faculty announcements
            for that kind of information</strong>. <br/>
          If no such communication channel exists, well, you should
          probably ask for one. Having to refresh a calendar view is a
            poor excuse for getting <em>change</em> notifications.

        <h3 id="qrcodes">What's the deal with these weird, scrambled chessboards?</h3>

        <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code">QR Codes</a> are images
            that encode bits of information. In this case, internet addresses.
            The typical use-case is to take a picture of that image with your camera-enabled
            (smart)phone, using a dedicated application, and a web page should open up.
        </p>
        <p>
            No shit. Just try it and have your mind blown. I'll wait.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: center">
            <a href="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=qr&chl=http://geholimport.appspot.com/student_set/m/SPLUS35F0C2&chs=512x512">

            </a>
        </p>
        <p> Feels like the future, doesn't it?</p>

        <p>
            In this service, every page with a schedule for a student profile
            will also display a QRCode which points to the mobile version of that page.
            From there, you will be able to quickly add the schedules in your native calendar application.
            To accomplish this, we use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webcal"><tt>webcal://</tt></a> URL scheme, and
            as far as we know, it only works with iCal for iOS at the moment.
            Sorry, Android folks. Maybe you can embrace openness, <a href="http://tartley.com/?p=1267">learn git</a> and
            contribute a patch or something.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, as entertaining as it is to open a page on your phone
            by taking a picture of the same page you just opened on your
            laptop, the usefulness is indeed questionable.
            This service really is aimed at professors, teaching assistants
            or anyone with teaching activities.
            Embed the code on your site. Print it and display it on the dead tree
            notification system. Yes, the one in your corridor. The hope is that
            it will give students a quicker access to their schedules.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Obviously, we're just trying out the idea. We'll see if it somehow catches up.
            Maybe we'll enhance it. Or Maybe we'll drop it.

    <div class="faq-entry">
        <h3  id="usability_matters">Why did you do it?</h3>
        <p>If we look past the rather irritating visual presentation,
          one fundamental flaw of the GeHoL/Scientia&reg; paradigm is
          the way information is presented.</p>

        <p>To take one of the most extreme examples, we don't think
          anyone's problem is being solved by this kind of schedule
          (click on the image to witness it in its full glory):</p>

        <p><a href="/media/Cours.png"><img src="/media/cours_truncated.png"
                                           width="100%"
                                           alt="extreme scheduling"
                                           title="GEHOL, Y U NO HELPFUL?!" /></a>
        </p>

        <p>Even with a simpler example, extracting useful information
           from each event box is tiresome and error-prone.  Why
           should people have to convert an arbitrary week number into
           a real date ?
        </p>
        
        <p>The purpose of a calendar system is to help you know when
          some important events occur.

          We think people should be able to integrate a schedule in
          their favorite calendar application.

          Providing
          an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">iCalendar</a>
          file is the best way to achieve that.
        </p>

    <div class="faq-entry">
        <h3 id="geholurl">What do you mean by <em>"complete GeHoL URL"</em> ? </h3>
        <p>
            This service can get you two types of schedules. The first
            one is per-course schedule. Using the course mnemonic, we
            can easily reconstruct the complete URL and fetch the data
            for you.  The second type of schedules, however, is
            problematic, and we need a little work on your part to
            generate the iCalendar files.
        </p>
        <p>
            You'll need to
            go <a href="http://164.15.72.157/GeHoL/horaire_anet.php">here</a>
            and select the values of interest as you normally would.
            The first two values are mandatory. The third one should
            be selected only if it makes sense to you. The fourth
            value won't be used, as we will generate events for the
            whole term. At the end, you should get something like
            this:
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="/media/Horaires.png"><img src="/media/Horaires.png"
            width="100%" alt="URL copying" title="Get yourself a GeHoL URL, for awesome superpowers" /></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Right click on the generated URL and copy it.
            Come back to our main page, paste this URL in the input
            box, click the <b>Get Schedule</b> button:

        <h3  id="snap">Something went wrong, what can I do? </h3>
        <p>
            We tried to test this service with many different sorts of
            schedules, from every faculty.

            However, parsing that kind of HTML is very fragile. We're
            not helped by the fact that the GeHoL/Scientia&reg;

            service sometimes yields incomplete data.  It would help
            if you could report unsuccessful queries to this address :
            <a href="mailto:geholimportapp@gmail.com?subject=Something
            about Gehol Importer">geholimportapp@gmail.com</a>.

        <h3  id="gehol_down">The GeHoL server is down, now what?</h3>
        <p>
            We have no control over that server. Sometimes it gets
            disconnected from the internet with no indication of what
            is going on.

            We try at least to show it clearly in the sidebar on the
            right.

    <div class="faq-entry">
        <h3  id="mandatory_ie_hate">The layout of this site looks broken in Internet Explorer</h3>
        <p>
            Yes. Yes it does. And we give up trying to fix it.

            You probably should not explore the internet with that
            anyway, and try one of the
